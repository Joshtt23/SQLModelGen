# SQLModelGenerator Code Generation Rules

- All code generation must use Jinja2 templates (see `src/sqlmodelgenerator/templates/`).
- One model file per table, one enum file per Postgres enum type.
- All models must inherit from `SQLModel, table=True` and use `Field(...)` for columns.
- Use type hints for all fields, including custom types for enums and JSON fields.
- Relationships must be detected and generated (forward and reverse).
- Generated code must be idempotent: re-running should not break or duplicate code.
- Do not require manual edits to generated files.
- All generated code must pass Black, Flake8, and mypy checks.
