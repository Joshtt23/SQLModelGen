# SQLModelGenerator Product Requirements (PRD)

This document summarizes the core requirements and design rules for the SQLModelGenerator project. All contributors should follow these principles:

## Core Principles
- **Automatic**: No manual schema files or TypeScript required.
- **Configurable**: Support exclusions, naming rules, and overrides via config.
- **Open-source-ready**: Clean structure, CLI, and documentation.
- **Reliable**: Accurately represent the DB schema, no special-cased hacks.

## Features & Rules
- Use SQLAlchemy introspection to reflect Postgres tables, columns, foreign keys, and enums.
- Generate one SQLModel file per table, and one Enum file per Postgres enum type.
- All models inherit from `SQLModel, table=True` and use `Field(...)` as needed.
- Support complex types: arrays, JSONB, enums, relationships.
- Detect and generate both forward and reverse relationships.
- All generated code must be idempotent (safe to re-generate).
- Use Jinja2 templates for all code generation.
- Configuration via `.sqlmodelgenerator.yaml` or `.toml` (see config rule).
- Output must be clean, readable, and ready for FastAPI.

## Future Enhancements
- Alembic migration stubs, SQLAlchemy model output, plugin hooks.

See the full PRD for details and rationale.
